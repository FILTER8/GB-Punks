# Bario Punks

Welcome to the Bario Punks Open Framework, where creativity, community, and freedom thrive. All art layers and code behind Bario Punks are now open-source, available for you to build on, remix, and innovate. Feel free to explore, create, and commercialize—just follow these basic guidelines to remain part of the Bario ecosystem!

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT License. Here’s what it means for you:

* You can use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the original work.
* Commercial use is allowed, so you can monetize your version of Bario Punks.
* Attribution is not required, but appreciated.
* There are no limitations on private use.
* Liability protection is provided, so you're free to create without legal concerns.

## Code of Conduct
While you are free to build on and commercialize this project, certain values are non-negotiable:

* **Deployment on Base:** Your Bario Punks derivative must be deployed on the Base network.
* **Royalty Sharing:** Creator royalties should not exceed 3%, and they must be equally split between you and the Baes treasury at `baes.base.eth`. This supports Bario’s ongoing development as a zero-funding startup.
* **Ethical Guidelines:** Derivatives must not promote racism, hate speech, discrimination, or any form of harmful content. Respect for all is core to our community. Violators will not receive Baes recognition.
* **Bario Punks Airdrop:** We encourage you to offer an airdrop to Bario Punks holders. The ratio is up to you (1:1, 1:5, 5:1).

By following these guidelines, you’ll be recognized as an official Baes ally and a vital part of our ecosystem. You’ll benefit from direct collaboration, potential partnerships, and increased visibility within the Base community.

## Next Steps
The Bario Punks open-source framework is all about pushing the boundaries of creativity and community in the onchain space. Join us, build something amazing, and contribute to a decentralized, open future for all.
